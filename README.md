This project implements a face recognition system that combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classification. The system is designed to efficiently recognize faces from a dataset, making it suitable for applications in security and user authentication.
PCA for Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces the dimensionality of face images while preserving essential features, improving computational efficiency.
ANN for Classification: Utilizes a neural network to classify and recognize faces based on the features extracted by PCA.
User -Friendly Interface: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction and testing.
